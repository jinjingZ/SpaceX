# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction Project


1. Collecting data via API and Web Scraping.
2. Data Wrangling, Exploratory Analysis (EDA) using SQL, Python (Pandas and Matplotlib).
3. Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium, Dash Plotly.
4. (Machine learning Prediction Modeling) Using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, and Logistic Regression. Finally, a test set is used for model evaluation, and F1 Score, Jaccard Score, and Log Loss are used to compare the accuracy of the models.
